SYNOPSIS DRAFTS,

Project Overview:
Design a game console using LPC1768 microcontroller, featuring a game where players input hexadecimal characters based on visual cues displayed on an LCD.

Components Used:

LPC1768 microcontroller
3 connectors
1 timer for tracking time and generating delays
8 LEDs for visual feedback and displaying time remaining
1 16x2 characters LCD display for game messages
4x4 matrix keyboard for inputing hexadecimal characters

Game States:

1.Start State / Difficulty Selector:

Players choose difficulty (0-3) by pressing keys on the keyboard.
Pressing any of the keys generates random hexadecimal values based on press duration (physical randomness produced by humans), and transitions the program to the Running State.

2.Running:

Display a randomly generated hexadecimal value on the first row of the LCD.
Players input corresponding characters via the keyboard, which are appended to the second row of the LCD display.
Each input character is compared with the corresponding character of the generated hexadecimal value:
If mismatch occurs, transition to FailOutcome State.
If characters match and input length matches the generated value, transition to WinOutcome State.

3.Result:

3.1.FailOutcome
Display "YOU LOST" on the LCD.

3.2.WinOutcome:
Display "YOU WIN" on the LCD.


This project offers an modest gaming experience utilizing various components and embedded programming logic to engage players in a minor challenge based on hexadecimal character recognition and input.
